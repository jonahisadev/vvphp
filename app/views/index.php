					Thanks for choosing vvPHP! After spending a few hours looking through multiple
					different PHP frameworks, I found that many of them either took too much time 
					to set up, or just plain didn't work very well. At the same time, I was fascinated
					with how they worked, so I decided to start building my own. I quite like it, and
					I hope you do too!
